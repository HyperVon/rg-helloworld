description: >-
  Audit agent rules, skills, and operating guidance for redundancy, conflicts,
  unclear triggering, stale assumptions, and consolidation opportunities. Use
  for repository-agnostic or cross-repository reviews of AGENTS.md files,
  SKILL.md files, harness rules, and agent instructions when asked to
  rationalize, merge, prune, or improve them. Prefer a repository-provided
  reviewer for domain-specific content enrichment; use this skill alongside it
  only when structural consolidation is explicitly requested.

# Rules and Skills Audit

Audit relevant guidance before proposing changes. Treat rules as policy and
skills as reusable task workflows; do not assume two files are redundant
merely because they share a topic.

## Procedure

1. Discover candidate guidance with `rg --files`, including nested
   `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, every `SKILL.md` under `.agents/skills/` and
   `.kilo/skills/`, `.kilo/operating.md`, `.kilo/command/*.md`,
   `.kilo/agent/*.md`, and `.github/workflows/*` if present. Include other
   harness-specific instruction files found nearby. Respect nested guidance
   and determine its scope before comparing it.
2. Build a compact inventory: file, purpose, scope, explicit trigger,
   dependencies, and notable rules or workflows. Record the files actually
   read and disclose any candidates skipped.
3. Compare candidates for duplicated instructions or checklists; overlapping
   triggers; broad workflows that subsume narrow ones; contradictory commands,
   versions, thresholds, or policy; stale facts or unreachable references;
    orphaned skills or index entries; and missing boundaries between central
    rules and task-specific skills. Treat harness projections and deliberate
    safety reinforcement as intentional when they name a canonical source and
    remain aligned. Ignore illustrative placeholders inside fenced examples
    when checking links. Also check for *harness projection drift*: whether
    harness-specific entrypoints (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursorrules`)
    have accumulated standalone instructions rather than acting as thin adapters
    pointing to canonical `.agents/` guidance. Projections must not become
    divergent second sources of truth.
4. For each finding, cite exact paths and headings (or line numbers), classify
   it as `duplicate`, `merge candidate`, `scope/trigger issue`,
   `stale/inaccurate`, `conflict`, or `improvement`, and state the evidence.
    Distinguish true duplication from intentional reinforcement. Do not treat
    word-frequency similarity as semantic equivalence; ignore illustrative
    fenced examples when checking links.
5. Rank proposed changes by impact and risk. Prefer focused skills with
   precise descriptions, shared canonical guidance, and references over
   repeating policy in every skill.
6. Do not delete, merge, or rewrite existing guidance without explicit
    approval. If asked to implement approved findings, preserve local
    conventions, update affected cross-references, and validate each modified
    skill.

## Always-on vs on-demand separation

Do not classify shared concepts between root rules and skills as duplicates.
Root guidance (`AGENTS.md`, operating files) must remain thin, universal, and
always-on, owning invariant boundaries, security guardrails, and routing
pointers. Skills are loaded on demand and own deep operational procedures,
domain checklists, and tool workflows. Reject merging on-demand skill bodies
into root instructions or deleting skill procedures because root rules
"already mention the topic."

Respect directory scoping: nested guidance files apply to their subdirectory
tree; do not consolidate stack-specific conventions into the repository root
if they would pollute context for unrelated tasks.

## Optional parallel audit

For a broad guidance tree, fan out bounded read-only workers per
[parallel-multi-agent](../parallel-multi-agent/SKILL.md): canonical rules and
operating norms, domain skills, commands/agents, and cross-link/index health.
Give each worker a bounded path set. The parent resolves duplicate or
conflicting findings and owns all edits.

## Report format

Provide:

- **Inventory summary** — files reviewed and overall health.
- **Findings** — evidence-backed items with affected paths and recommended
  action.
- **Keep separate** — apparent overlaps justified by distinct scope or
  audience.
- **Proposed consolidation plan** — ordered, reversible steps; include a
  migration map for any merge.
- **No-change conclusion** — state this explicitly if no material improvement
  is supported.

Avoid recommendations based only on file names. Do not suggest cosmetic edits
unless they improve triggering, correctness, maintainability, or agent
behavior.
