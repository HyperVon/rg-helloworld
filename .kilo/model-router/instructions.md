# Routed Workflow Orchestration

The project has a route-enforcing subagent launcher at
`.kilo/model-router/route-subagents`. Use it for broad workflows that define
parallel discovery or review tracks.

When the initial `route-kilo` prompt contains a known repository skill reference
such as `/open-pr` or `/documentation-review`, the launcher resolves the
reference to `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and prepends an instruction for the
main session to read and follow that file. Unknown slash commands are passed
through unchanged.

## Skill Mapping

Use the matching workflow preset instead of asking the user to create or edit a
manifest:

| Skill | Preset |
| :--- | :--- |
| `documentation-review` | `documentation-review` |
| `code-review` | `code-review` |
| Documentation-review adversarial re-review | `documentation-adversarial-review` |
| `autonomous-code-optimizer` | `autonomous-code-optimizer` |
| `continuous-quality` | `continuous-quality` |
| `continuous-improvement` | `continuous-improvement` |
| `comprehensive-quality-overhaul` | `comprehensive-quality-overhaul` |
| `adversarial-pr-review` | `adversarial-pr-review` |
| `ai-slop-detector` | `ai-slop-detector` |
| `complex-code-comments` | `complex-code-comments` |
| `dependency-upgrade` | `dependency-upgrade` |
| `architecture-review` | `architecture-review` |
| `rules-and-skills-audit` | `rules-and-skills-audit` |
| `skill-reviewer` | `skill-reviewer` |

## Launch Contract

When a named workflow reaches its parallel-discovery step:

1. Decompose only the independent read-only discovery tracks required by the
   workflow. The preset supplies bounded scopes and specialized agent roles.
2. Plan routes and quota with the parent request as task context:

   ```bash
   ./.kilo/model-router/route-subagents \
      --workflow <preset> \
      --task "<the user's workflow request>" \
      --run
   ```

3. The command prints the complete route/quota plan before launching. The
   user's request to run the named read-only workflow authorizes this bounded
   discovery fan-out; do not ask the user to hand-edit a manifest. Omit `--run`
   only when the workflow explicitly requires a separate human route decision.
   Keep `adversarial-pr-review` in plan-only mode until its review-specific
   approval gate is satisfied.
4. Keep implementation, edits, backlog integration, Makefile gates, k3d, and
   final verification in the parent unless the workflow explicitly says
   otherwise. Never use `--allow-edits` for standard discovery.

Independent tracks must launch concurrently. If using a host Task equivalent
instead of the launcher, submit all independent calls in one parallel tool
message; never describe sequential foreground launches as fan-out.

For adversarial or second-pass review, inspect the generated route report
before calling the result an independent-model review. A role name or Auto
tier is not evidence of model diversity. If the actual provider/model routes
are the same, report that no independent route was obtained and rerun the
disputed track through a different host-enforceable route when the risk
justifies it. The adversarial presets request distinct exact routes for their
tracks; if availability prevents that, the launcher records the reuse warning
instead of claiming diversity.

The launcher selects an exact provider/model independently for every track,
uses the installed quota plugin, and applies bounded runtime failover. A raw
Kilo `Task` call remains unrouteable and must not be used as a substitute.
When the user explicitly asks for a different model or delegation, stop parent
implementation and perform the exact-route handoff first. Do not claim that a
role-only Task call changed the model; if no host-enforceable route is
available, state that limitation and keep the work parent-owned.

Each `--run` writes a secret-free Markdown and JSON route report under
`~/.cache/kilo/model-router/reports/` and prints the Markdown path after the
workers finish. Reports include track scope, profile, planned and used
provider/model, billing, benchmark/capability/quota metadata, timing, and
failovers. They intentionally omit parent prompts, worker report text,
credentials, and raw provider errors. Set `KILO_MODEL_ROUTER_REPORT_DIR` or
pass `--report-dir` to choose another local destination.

After the workers finish, the launcher also prints a compact `Route summary`
table to stdout: track, status, the planned-to-used provider/model route chain
(including failovers), profile, billing, and duration. The parent session must
relay that per-track route summary into the conversation so the operator sees
which providers/models ran which tasks without opening the report directory.
Keep the relay one table or a few lines; do not paste the full report.

When a catalog exposes model variants, the selected profile chooses one instead
of silently accepting the provider default: trivial/routine prefer low/medium,
coding prefers medium/high, complex-coding/agentic prefer high/thinking, and
quick-review/detailed-review/critical prefer xhigh/max, with model-specific
fallbacks. Headless workers use `--variant`; the full TUI receives a temporary
agent configuration overlay and does not modify the project config. High-risk
profiles (detailed-review, critical) prioritize capability evidence; free
routes remain eligible when they satisfy the profile and policy. Only explicit
blacklist patterns exclude models or providers.

Ranking only considers candidates that satisfy every eligibility gate:
sufficiently qualified (quality must be assessable and meet the profile minimum
— routes whose capability is unknown or cannot be assessed are never
considered), accessible and useable (active, tool-capable, quota not exhausted,
policy-permitted and available). Profile inference classifies deliberation
tasks (review, audit, documentation, analysis, workflow, delegation) as a
`review` profile rather than `coding`, so a code review is held to a higher
intelligence minimum. Among the eligible set, routes are ordered by lowest
effective cost, then by smallest capability headroom above the profile minimum
(so a just-sufficient small/fast model wins a trivial task, yet a genuinely
strong model wins where the minimum is high), then by an already-paid
subscription over PAYG, then by higher available quota (to prefer headroom and
spread load), then by unknown quota deprioritized. High-risk profiles
(`detailed-review`, `critical`) add a margin above their minimum, so
integrity/security work never routes to a barely adequate model. A free or
cheaper route (quality still above the minimum) therefore outranks a more
expensive higher-quality route; quota headroom breaks cost ties. Free-billing
models whose quota state is `unknown` (the quota plugin does not meter free
models) are treated as usable and compete on cost like confirmed-sufficient
routes rather than being pushed behind them. Subscription / account-priced
routes keep their real per-task cost (they still burn a token budget), so a
smaller model wins over a large one at a similar effective price; on an
effective-cost tie a subscription route is preferred over a PAYG one.

Before a selected free route is used, the router sanity-checks its sustained
throughput with a short probe (an OpenAI-compatible chat completion that asks
for roughly a thousand characters of output, capped by `tpsProbe.maxTokens`),
and re-selects the next best route when the measured tokens/sec stays below
`tpsProbe.minTps` (default 20). Probe results are cached under
`~/.cache/kilo/model-router/tps.json` for `tpsProbe.cacheMinutes` (default 60)
so warm startups stay fast; unmeasurable routes (no endpoint, no key, probe
error) never block selection. The probe times out after
`min(tpsProbe.timeoutSeconds, tpsProbe.probeCharacters / tpsProbe.minTps)`
seconds (50s by default) and a timed-out route is cached at 0 tokens/sec, so it
stays excluded for the cache window instead of being re-probed. If every free
route is too slow, selection falls back to the next cheapest qualifying route,
paid if necessary, and warns.
Tune or disable via the `tpsProbe` section of `.kilo/model-router/config`.

Standard read-only workers run from temporary repository copies, so an agent
that ignores its prompt cannot modify the parent worktree. `--allow-edits` is
the explicit exception for a custom manifest with owned writable paths.

Persistent route exclusions live in `.kilo/model-router/config` under
`blacklist`. `blacklist.models` accepts glob patterns matching either a full
`provider/model` route or a model ID; `blacklist.providers` excludes every
model from a provider. Keep both arrays empty unless an operator asks to
exclude a route. A future model-selection update should edit those arrays and
verify the next route plan; the blacklist is applied before capability, cost,
and quota ranking for both the primary launcher and routed workers.

End-of-life models are added to `blacklist.models` automatically: when a launch
answers HTTP 410 / "end of life" (`model_eol`), both `route-kilo` runs and
routed subagents append the exact dead route to the tracked
`.kilo/model-router/config` and immediately retry the next best candidate
without excluding the provider. That write is intentional and will appear as a
config diff to review and commit — an EOL is a universal fact worth sharing,
and the explicit `--run` gate already authorized the run that discovered it.
