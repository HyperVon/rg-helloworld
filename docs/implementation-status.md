Milestone 0 scope below is derived from section 29 (Implementation Sequence) and
section 24 (Repository Structure) of that document.

## Milestone 0 — Repository skeleton

### Scope

- Repository directory structure matching section 24 of the architecture.
- Root `Makefile` exposing the full required target interface; Milestone 0
  targets (`prerequisites`, `format`, `lint`, `unit`, `build`, `clean`) are
  functional, later targets are placeholders.
- Version-management files: `versions.env`, `.tool-versions`, `.ruby-version`,
  `.nvmrc`, `global.json`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `Directory.Packages.props`,
  `go.mod`, `gradle` wrapper, `Cargo.lock`, `package-lock.json`,
  `Gemfile.lock`, `requirements-dev.txt`.
- Formatter and linter configuration for every language:
  `gofmt`/`go vet`, Spotless (Java), ktlint (Kotlin), `clang-format` (C++),
  `dotnet format` (C#), ruff (Python), prettier + `tsc --noEmit`
  (TypeScript), rubocop (Ruby), `rustfmt` + clippy (Rust), plus markdownlint
  and shellcheck for documentation and scripts.
- Minimal compilable, unit-tested skeleton project for every required
  language (see table below), with 90% coverage gates per language
  (`make coverage`).
- Cross-language integration harness (`tests/integration/run_integration.sh`)
  that builds every service artifact and asserts each binary's version
  contract.
- Milestone acceptance e2e harness (`tests/end-to-end/run_e2e.sh`) that runs
  all gates plus the integration harness.
- `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/implementation-status.md`, initial ADR
  directory (`docs/adr/`), runbook/troubleshooting/artifact-lineage stubs.
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that compiles and unit-tests each
  skeleton service, runs format checks and 90% coverage gates, and executes
  the integration and e2e harnesses.
- `scripts/prerequisites.sh` toolchain checker.
- Root `README.md` explaining that functionality is not yet implemented.
- Agent configuration for AI harnesses: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.windsurfrules`,
  and Kilo commands/agents/skills under `.kilo/`.

Explicitly **not** in scope for Milestone 0: Kafka, Kubernetes, SOAP, gRPC,
OCR, MinIO, PostgreSQL, Redis, Terraform, observability, web front ends, and
any business functionality.

### Skeleton services

### Tasks

- [x] Create repository directory structure.
- [x] Write `docs/architecture.md` (committed with the initial repository).
- [x] Write root `Makefile` with the complete target interface.
- [x] Write version-management files.
- [x] Write formatter and linter configurations for all languages.
- [x] Create compilable skeleton projects for all required languages.
- [x] Add a unit test to every skeleton project.
- [x] Add a 90% coverage gate per language (`make coverage`).
- [x] Create the cross-language integration harness (`make integration`).
- [x] Create the milestone acceptance e2e harness (`make e2e`).
- [x] Write `docs/implementation-status.md`.
- [x] Create `docs/adr/` with the initial ADRs (0001–0005).
- [x] Create runbook/troubleshooting/artifact-lineage document stubs.
- [x] Write `scripts/prerequisites.sh`.
- [x] Write `.github/workflows/ci.yml` compiling and testing every skeleton.
- [x] Write root `README.md`.
- [x] Add agent configuration for AI harnesses (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
      Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Kilo commands/agents/skills).

### Acceptance conditions

```bash
make format
make lint
make unit
make coverage
make build
make integration
make e2e
```

must all pass from the repository root, with every required language toolchain
installed.

### Verification log

| Date | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-04 | `make format` | PASS |
| 2026-08-04 | `make lint` | PASS |
| 2026-08-04 | `make unit` | PASS |
| 2026-08-04 | `make coverage` | PASS (all gates 90%+, Go 100%, Java 100%, Kotlin 100%, Python 94%, Node 100%, Ruby 100%, .NET 100%) |
| 2026-08-04 | `make build` | PASS |
| 2026-08-04 | `make integration` | PASS (11/11 banners) |
| 2026-08-04 | `make e2e` | PASS |

### Milestone 0 limitations

- `web/` (React, Angular) contains placeholder directories only; the web shell,
  telemetry element, and HTMX inspector arrive in Milestone 10.
- `contracts/` is empty; all contracts arrive in Milestone 1.
- Infrastructure directories (`infra/`, `observability/`, `scripts/*.sh`
  beyond `prerequisites.sh`) are placeholders.
- `make contracts/images/cluster/infra/deploy/wait/run/demo/chaos/diagnostics/
  down/destroy` are interface stubs and report not implemented.
- The integration harness covers skeleton artifacts only; platform-backed
  integration suites (Kafka, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, SOAP, gRPC, SSE)
  arrive in Milestones 2–3. The true e2e (`rghello run` printing
  `Hello World`) arrives in Milestone 9; the current e2e proves the gates
  plus the cross-language artifact contract.
- Rust and C++ coverage gates run in CI (cargo-llvm-cov, gcovr); locally they
  report a skip when the tool or a GNU compiler is unavailable.
- The .NET rasterizer project uses a 3-project structure (library, CLI,
  tests) to achieve proper Coverlet coverage instrumentation.
- `rghello` does not accept `--message` or any other option yet.
- The Makefile skips a language whose toolchain is missing; CI runs strict
  with the full toolchain.

### Next milestone

Milestone 1 — Contracts: OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schemas, WSDL/XSD, protobuf,
valid examples, the `make contracts` generation target, and prohibited-field
tests. Not started until Milestone 0 acceptance passes.
